# 0. Project Summary
This is an ongoing project understanfig foraging innovtaion, tool use, and dispersal ecology and beahvior of the only known population of stone tool useing white-faced capuching monkeys in the world. 
They live on the islands of Coiba and Jicaron in Coiba National Park, Panama. 
As these are unhabitatuated monkeys in remote areas, we rely mostly on non-invasive sampling via camera trapping, non-invasive genetic sampling, archaeological surveys of stone tools, plant surveys, and remote sensing.

Data for 1-7 can be found in the [corresponding metadata file here.](https://github.com/livingingroups/project_metadata/blob/main/project_metadata/metadata_template.txt)

# 8. Data File Details
Here is a link to our data catalogue entry form (hypothetical link here).
We collected data from 13 camera traps in December, and deployed 13 more. 

# 9. Hardware
In the field, GPS coordinates of iinteresting landmarks and tracks of researchers, were taken with a [Garmin Inreach Explorer Plus](https://buy.garmin.com/de-DE/DE/p/561269) (insert department #). Stone tool and camera trap locations were recorded with a [Emlid Reach RS2](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/) synced to Brendan's android phone. These coordinates were recorded using KoboCollect into a csv column.
# 10. Software
Stone tool locations and camera trap deplyment info was recorded using 2 Kobo collect forms. While this automatically backs up when a cell phone signal is recorded, it was synced locally to Brendan's computer using this source code. Links to form output can be found **here**

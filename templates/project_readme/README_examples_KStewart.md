## LuiKotale Bonobo Project (LKBP)
LuiKotale Field Site, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa
README - Project Folder
## Project Description: 
Iodine is a trace mineral required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which control and/or regulate organ development, growth, reproduction and metabolism in all vertebrate species. The LKBP Iodine Project is a research project aimed at (i) defining iodine availability at the LuiKotale field site in order to resolve uncertainty about whether it is an iodine-deficient area; and (ii) identifying foraging strategies bonobos use to obtain sufficient quantities of iodine to meet their biological needs. Ultimately, resolving these questions will offer insight into the role iodine played in human brain evolution and early human dispersal into continental habitats. The project was developed by Dr. Barbara Fruth (project P.I.) and Kathrine Stewart (LKBP field assistant). All data were collected by Kathrine Stewart and Nicolás Corredor-Ospina (LKBP field assistant). 
## Data Description
**Folder Title:** LKBP_Iodine_Project
**Folder Directory:** `\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\working\newdata\`
**Folder Description:** Working directory containing data collected specifically for the LKBP Iodine Project. Data are organized by type into three sub-folders:
1. FF_voice_recordings – raw audio recordings of feeding intake rates for feeding focals. Data for each focal and day are organized into separate sub-folders labelled with the date and focal ID (e.g., 22Jan2019_Zoe). 

2.	FF_transcribed_data – Excel (.xlxs) spreadsheets containing feeding intake rates for each feeding focal, transcribed from the audio recordings. Data are organized into 3 spreadsheets: (i) data collected by Kathrine Stewart; (ii) data collected by Nicolás Corredor-Ospina; and (iii) a master list containing data from both field assistants. 

3.	N2_Samples – Excel (.xlxs) file listing all biological samples (e.g., plant, animal tissue, urine and water) that were collected for the project. For each sample, relevant details such as time, date, location and N2 running number are included in the list. 
In addition to the above sub-folders, the project folder contains a project protocol – titled LKBP_Iodine_Project_protocol – with details about how and why the data were collected.



# README: EXAMPLE 2
This is an example of a README.txt file included with an Excel file containing long-term data for a research project. It describes the types of data included in the data file, with brief explanations of how the data was collected.
## LuiKotale Bonobo Project (LKBP)
LuiKotale Field Site, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa
README - Data File
## Data Description: 
**File Title:** LKBP_ICE_from_30Sept2016
**File Directory:** \\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\working\newdata\IGEs\
**File Description:** Excel (.xlsx) file containing data collected during intergroup encounters (IGEs) between parties of bonobos at the LuiKotale field site.
**File Summary:** This file contains data collected by local and international field assistants during IGEs from 30-Sept-2016 onwards. All data is entered into the sheet titled ‘LKBP_ICE’. Descriptions for each column and details for how data should be formatted for entry are provided in the sheet titled ‘Legend’. 
The data consist of two types: (i) spatial data in the form of GPS waypoints (x, y co-ordinates) collected using a handheld Garmin® GPS unit (models 64 and above); and (ii) observational data collected manually by field assistants using field notebooks, CyberTracker® software and/or a voice recorder (Dictaphone). Data include IGE start and end times and their locations (as waypoints); party compositions before and after the IGE; reported injuries; and interaction type (e.g., acoustical, visual or both) and intensity (e.g., aggressive or peaceful). Descriptive summaries of each IGE are provided in the column ‘Free style narrative’. 
File Creation: The file was created in July 2020. Data for IGEs that occurred between 30-Sept-2016 and 28-Feb-2021 were compiled by Kathrine Stewart from the following data sources:
- Intercommunity excel_old.xlxs (1)
- Intercommunity Encounter updated.docx (1)
- Intercommunity Encounter on the 9th of february.docx (1)
- West_Daily Summary and Party Comp_from May 2016_current.xlsx (2)
- EAST - All Occurrence Data - 2017 LTS.xls (2)
- LTS_EAST_Focal Data_until05feb19.xlsx (2)
- EAST - Daily summary and party composition_LTS August 2017 (2)
- EAST - LB Data Feb 2018.xls (2)
- EAST - Worker data.xls (2)
- west_lts_data.xlsx (2)
- LTSdatafile_combinedW&E_from13.02.2019.xlsx (3)
- Folder: GPS_backups containing GPS track logs (.gpx format) from 2013 onwards 
All of these data files can be found in the following directories: 
1.	`\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\archive\IGEs\ `
2.	`\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\archive\LTS\ `
3.	`\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\working\newdata\LTS\`
4.	`\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\archive\GPS_backups\`

The location of each data file listed above is denoted with the corresponding number of the directory. For example, West_Daily Summary and Party Comp_from May 2016_current (2) is located in the directory `\\10.126.19.90\EAS_shared\bonobo\archive\LTS\`.
